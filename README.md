# YILIM

YILIM is a Discord bot dedicated to our Turkish programming community
with its quality of life improvements. The main idea behind YILIM was
to create a maintainable question pool that only Discord threads was
allowed. YILIM is the assistant that uses Discord interactions and
creates those threads, therefore enforcing a thread-only and logged
question pool. Currently, its logging functionality isn't implemented
yet.

This repository not just includes YILIM related functionality, but
also, an easy to use command framework and command templating system.
If you are interested in framework of YILIM, directory you should be
looking for is ``command``.

As of 2021, no mortal being is able to decipher the meaning of YILIM,
and I'd like to keep that as a secret of mine for unforeseen future.
